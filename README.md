For part 1: Assume the data in the Boston Housing data set fits a linear model. When fit, how much impact does each factor have on the value of a house in Boston? Display these results from greatest to least.  
  
For part 2: Both the Wine and the Iris datasets are built with the assumption that there are 3 populations in the sample. Using the elbow heuristic, demonstrate with a graph that 3 is the correct (or incorrect) number of populations to use.
